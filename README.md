## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```




### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-k-grunt from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-k-grunt
```



## Usage
Make a new directory, and `cd` into it:

```bash
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Initiate the generator:

```bash
yo k-grunt
```

Run `grunt serve` for preview.




## Generators
* `yo k-grunt`: generates a new web app.
* `yo k-grunt:page`: generates a page, including a jade, a script and a stylesheet.




## Waiting for optimize
* modularization
